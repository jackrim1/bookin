                <li>I spent around 5 years in the army and one of the things that really annoyed me was the lack of tech adoption for everyday things. As the world around us becomes ever more connected and mobile-based I think it's time those in the armed forces deserve some innovation too. I'm keen to hear from anyone who has any ideas, no matter how wacky so email me at: jack@bookin.today </li></br>
